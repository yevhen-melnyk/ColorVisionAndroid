# ColorVisionAndroid
An android app that aims to help colorblind people. You may find an apk ready to install in apk folder, though you'd need to allow installation from unknown sources on your device to use it. Also expect bugs and layout inconsistencies :/ 

**Warning**: do not rely on this app in serious situations as colors may be false interpreted in dark environments. Also depending on your camera's light sensitivity red and yellow may be interpreted as similar.

Default settings are set to protanopia (the most common, red color colorblindness). If you suffer from a different kind of colorblindness open the settings and choose it if it\'s supported. 

Different colors will be displayed in different patterns:
    Red is displayed as a checkers grid. 
    Green is displayed as triangles. 
    Blue is displayed as circles. 
    Yellow is displayed as a diamond grid.
